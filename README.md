## Challenges

We faced challenges in regards to sourcing and binning our data.

Sourcing: Our data comes from a Github Repo that a third-party person compiled from Crunchbase. In order to actually source data from Crunchbase, we would need a premium account ($300 to make one). Furthermore, the free trial premium did not allow full access to the data (i.e. downloading .csv files) and any attempts to scrape Crunchbases webpages were immediately denied, so webscraping more data was extremely unfeasible.

Binning: A lot of our project revolves around analyzing investment habits based around various sectors of companies. Our dataset has a column that denotes the sector(s) that a company fall under, but this is presented in the form of a string with the format "(sector) | (sector) | (sector)". With this label, there were over 16,000 unique tags in this column, so a binning system had to be used instead. This was solved by separating the sectors, making them a column in our data, and having the data value be 1 if that company is in that sector, and 0 otherwise. Unfortunately, this causes some issues with how representative our data is because a singular investment can fall under multiple sectors.
